To create a modular solution for the unique challenges of uploading various numbers of (possibly large) files,
 storing those files on a server and recording user submitted meta-data about those files to a specified database.

This software is meant to be used as part of the Setr.us website. It is hosted in it's own repository in the hopes that a more modular solution will be produced.
